      "TensorFlow and Keras: Enables building and training deep learning models with GPU support and production deployment capabilities.\n",
      "PyTorch: Provides a flexible tensor-based framework with GPU support for building and training neural networks.\n",
      "Setting Up Python for Machine Learning\n",
      "Before starting with Machine Learning, you need a proper Python environment. There are two commonly used methods to set up Python for ML tasks.\n",
      "1. Install Python Directly\n",
      "Before moving to the next step, install Python on your system.\n",
      "Refer to: How to install Python\n",
      "This gives you a basic Python setup where you can manually install additional libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow and scikit-learn using pip.\n",
      "2. Install Anaconda\n",
      "Anaconda is a popular distribution for data science and ML because it comes with many essential tools pre-installed. It includes:\n",
      "Jupyter Notebook for writing and testing ML code interactively\n",
      "conda package manager for easy installation and environment management\n",
      "Pre-installed ML libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and scikit-learn\n",
      "Refer to: How to Install Anaconda \n",
      "Anaconda simplifies environment setup and avoids dependency issues, making it ideal for beginners and professionals working on machine learning projects.\n",
      "Python Data Structures for Machine Learning\n",
      "Data structures enable efficient storage and processing of ML data in Python.\n",
      "Lists: Used to store sequences of values like predictions, losses or intermediate preprocessing results during ML workflows.\n",
      "Tuples: Store fixed, unchangeable configurations such as image shapes or model parameter settings.\n",
      "Sets: Used to remove duplicates and quickly check unique categories or class labels in datasets.\n",
      "Dictionaries: Help map relationships such as class-name-to-ID, hyperparameters and model configurations.\n",
      "NumPy Arrays: Store numerical data efficiently and perform fast vectorized operations essential for ML algorithms.\n",
      "Data Processing in Python\n",
      "Data preprocessing is a crucial step in Machine Learning as it ensures clean, consistent and meaningful data for model training.\n",
      "Handling Missing Values: Fill or remove missing entries using statistical methods or forward/backward fill.\n",
      "Handling Outliers: Detect outliers with IQR or Z-score and treat them based on domain needs.\n",
      "Encoding Categorical Data: Convert categories into numbers using Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding or Target Encoding.\n",
      "Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize features to ensure stable and balanced model training.\n",
      "Handling Imbalanced Data: Use SMOTE, oversampling or undersampling to balance uneven class distributions.\n",
      "Data Processing with Pandas: Pandas simplifies cleaning, filtering, merging and organizing datasets efficiently.\n",
      "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
      "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step in Machine Learning that helps identify patterns, relationships and anomalies in the dataset before model building.\n",
      "Common EDA Techniques\n",
      "Summary statistics to understand central tendency and spread of data\n",
      "Distribution analysis to examine how features are distributed\n",
      "Correlation heatmaps to study relationships between numerical features\n",
      "Pair plots for visualizing feature interactions\n",
      "Boxplots to detect outliers and variations across categories\n",
      "Machine Learning Workflow in Python\n",
      "Workflow\n",
      "A Machine Learning project follows a structured lifecycle, where each stage prepares the foundation for the next. The workflow shown in the image can be mapped to the following steps:\n",
      "Define Strategy: Understand the problem, business goal and the approach to solve it.\n",
      "Data Collection: Gather high-quality data from databases, APIs, sensors or public sources.\n",
      "Data Preprocessing: Clean data by handling missing values, fixing outliers, encoding categories and scaling features.\n",
      "Data Modeling: Select the right ML algorithm and prepare the model structure.\n",
      "Training and Evaluation: Train the model and assess performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score or RMSE.\n",
      "Optimization: Tune hyperparameters and refine features to boost performance.\n",
      "Deployment: Integrate the trained model into applications, APIs or cloud systems.\n",
      "Monitoring: Track model accuracy, drift and latency during real-world usage.\n",
      "Retraining: Update the model with new data to maintain accuracy over time.\n",
      "Python provides a smooth workflow from start to finish. As you continue learning, Python will remain a reliable and flexible tool for solving real-world machine learning problems.\n",
